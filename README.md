# Interactive Systems Visualisations

Based on stock-and-flow diagrams from the book Thinking in Systems (Donella H. Meadows), but interactive to control the in- and outflow.

See https://jzaefferer.github.io/systems-interactive/

Currently contains only a basic bathtub example. Adding more complicated examples with reinforcing and balancing feedback loops is going to make this much more interesting.

## Running Locally

Opening the HTML file directly doesn't work due to CORS, so a local web server is needed:

1. download or clone with git
2. run a local webserver, like `npx serve` (based on node+npm)
3. open in browser, like http://localhost:5000/ when using `npx serve`
